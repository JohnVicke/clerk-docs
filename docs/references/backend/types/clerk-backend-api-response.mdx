# `ClerkBackendApiResponse`

An interface that describes the response of a Clerk backend API request.

## `ClerkBackendApiResponse` properties

| Properties | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `data` | `T[]` |  An object that contains the fetched data. |
| `errors` | `ClerkAPIError[]` | An array of errors that occurred during the request. |
| `totalCount?` | `number` |  The total count of data that exist remotely. Only for requests that contain pagination information or where `data` is an array. |
| `clerkTraceId?` | `string` |  The Clerk trace ID for the request. |
| `status?` | `number` |  The HTTP status code of the response. |
| `statusText?` | `string` |  The HTTP status text of the response. |

On most requests to the backend API, you'll get back `{ data, errors }`. For requests that contain pagination information or where `data` is an array, you'll also receive `totalCount`. If an error happens, you'll get `errors` and in most cases also `clerkTraceId`, `status`, and `statusText`.
